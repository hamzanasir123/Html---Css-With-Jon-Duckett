<h3>Adding Image</h3>

<h6>Height & Width Of Images</h6>

<p>There are around 10,000 living species of birds 
    that inhabit different ecosystems from the 
    Arctic to the Antarctic. Many species undertake 
    long distance annual migrations, and many more 
    perform shorter irregular journeys.</p>

<h1>Three Rules Of Adding Image To The Websites</h1>
<h2>1</h2>
<p>
<h3>
Save images in 
the right format</h3>
Websites mainly use images in 
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you 
choose the wrong image 
format then your image might 
not look as sharp as it should 
and can make the web page 
slower to load.
<h2>2</h2>
<h3>Save images at 
the right size</h3>
You should save the image at 
the same width and height it will 
appear on the website. If 
the image is smaller than the 
width or height that you have 
specified, the image can be 
distorted and stretched. If the 
image is larger than the width 
and height if you have specified, 
the image will take longer to 
display on the page.
<h2>3</h2>
<h3>Use the correct
resolution</h3>
Computer screens are made up 
of dots known as pixels. Images 
used on the web are also made 
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers 
to the number of dots per inch, 
and most computer screens only 
show web pages at 72 pixels 
per inch. So saving images at 
a higher resolution results in 
images that are larger than 
necessary and take longer to 
download     
</p>

<h3>Figure And FigCaption</h3>

<Figure>
    <img src="/images/images.png" height="200"
    width="200" alt="Image">
    <figcaption>
        This Is A PeraGraph
    </figcaption>
</Figure>

<!--
 The <img> element is used to add images to a 
 web page.
 You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the 
 source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
 content of an image.
 You should save images at the size you will be using 
 them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
 Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
 logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs
